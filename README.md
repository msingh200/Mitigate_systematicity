# This is the repo containing the technical assessment code.

## The powerpoint that I emailed contains the steps and explanation. I also explain the steps briefly in my code.


### The files in the repo are:
1. data_preprocessing_individual_models.py: contains code that I used for data cleaning, running 10 individuals models, and noting their accuracy, precision and recall

2. Model1.py: contains code executing my preferred model for generating bounded randomness at prediction

3. Model2.py: contains code executing model where a random subset of models is chosen at prediction

4. The rest of the files here are data/outputs saved during various stages of solving the problem
